# Restaurant_Reservation

A restaurant reservation system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is a comprehensive solution for managing reservations, table availability, and customer bookings for restaurants.

Overview:
The restaurant reservation system allows customers to view available tables, make reservations for specific dates and times, modify or cancel existing reservations, and receive confirmation of their bookings. Restaurant staff can manage reservations, update table availability, view customer details, and handle reservation requests efficiently.

  -View available tables by date and time.
  -Make, modify, or cancel reservations.
  -Provide customer details such as name, contact information, and special requests.
  -Receive confirmation emails or SMS for successful reservations.
2. Restaurant Staff Interface:
   -View and manage reservations (create, update, delete).
   -Check table availability and assign tables to reservations.
   -Communicate with customers regarding their reservations.
   -Generate reports on reservation trends, peak hours, etc.

3.Reservation Management:
  -Allow customers to search for available tables based on date, time, and party size.
  -Handle reservation requests, including creation, modification, and cancellation.

4.Real-time Updates:
  -Utilize web sockets or real-time databases to provide live updates on table availability and reservation status.
5.Reporting and Analytics:
  -Generate reports and analytics on reservation statistics, such as peak hours, popular dishes, etc.
6.Integration with POS Systems:
  -Integrate with Point of Sale (POS) systems to sync reservation data with restaurant operations.

  -Express.js: as the web application framework for Node.js.
  -MongoDB: as the NoSQL database for storing reservations, customer details, etc.
  -Mongoose: as the MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
3.Authentication:
  -JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
  -bcrypt.js for password hashing and verification.
4.Real-time Updates:
  -Socket.IO: for enabling real-time communication between the server and clients.
5.Deployment:
  -Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration.
